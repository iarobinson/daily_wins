# Torture Your Friends

## What this is

A simple application where you can create challenges and invite your friends to do hard things with you on a daily basis.

## To Do

- Empower wins to store pictures via ActiveStorage (installed but i think it's configured improperly)
- Currently something is broken in regards to saving wins
- Associate wins with their challenge
- Add testing
- Move from Skeleton to Bootstrap in good time
- Add Material Icons

## Tech

- [Devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) for user authentication
- [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0) for mobile friendliness
- [Calendar Views from D3](https://observablehq.com/@d3/calendar-view)
